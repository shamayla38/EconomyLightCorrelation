# Night-Time Light and Economic Growth Correlation
## Purpose
This project aims to analyze the relationship between night-time light (NTL) intensity and economic indicators (e.g., GDP). While significant research has already explored the use of NTL as a proxy for economic activity, this study expands the scope by including all available years, including the latest data, for a in depth temporal analysis.

## Data Overview
### Input Data

#### Raw Data:

Source: Night-time light data in TIFF format (e.g., harmonized VIIRS NTL data).
Location: data/raw_data/ (not included in the repository due to size).
Intermediate Data:

#### Year-wise Data:

Generated by extracting and aggregating NTL data with country-level shapefiles.
Location: data/analysis_data/yearwise/ (not included in the repository due to size).

#### Aggregated Data:

Final dataset combining all years, aggregated by country and stored in an efficient Parquet format.
Location: data/analysis_data/aggregated/final_aggregated_data.parquet.

## Scripts

1. data_extraction.py
Purpose: Extracts pixel-level data (latitude, longitude, and DN values) from NTL TIFF files and merges it with country shapefiles.
Output: CSV files containing country-wise DN values for each year (data/analysis_data/yearwise/).

3. data_cleaning.py
Purpose: Cleans and processes the year-wise data by:
Removing rows without a valid country.
Grouping by country and summing DN values for each year.
Output: Cleaned year-wise CSV files in data/analysis_data/yearwise/.

5. aggregate_data.py
Purpose: Combines all cleaned year-wise datasets into a single file, with summed DN values by country across years.
Output: final_aggregated_data.parquet in data/analysis_data/aggregated/.
Reproducibility

## Steps to Reproduce:

### Prerequisites:

Python 3.8+ with the following libraries:


Copy code

pip install pandas geopandas rasterio numpy shapely ggplot

#### Process the Data:

Place raw TIFF files in data/raw_data/.
Run the scripts in the following order:
1) data_extraction.py: Extracts data from TIFF files and merges with country shapefile.
2) data_cleaning.py: Cleans and processes the year-wise data.
3) aggregate_data.py: Aggregates cleaned data into a single Parquet file.

Final Output:
Aggregated dataset: data/analysis_data/aggregated/final_aggregated_data.parquet.
